/*========The following example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately=========*/
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function
// Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed
// â€” these are called asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .then() block
// chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects.
//This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as fetch().

  const name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
